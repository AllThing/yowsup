A clone of tgalal's [Yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup) library

WhatsApp Inc has issued a [takedown notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2014-02-12-WhatsApp.md) to tgalal's official Yowsup repository. It is my belief that his work is permissible under [Section 1201(f)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) which allows for Reverse Engineering any protected work in order to achieve interoperability on various platforms. I hope [tgalal](https://github.com/tgalal) initiates legal proceedings against WhatsApp Inc for damages under [Section 512(f)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) for their misrepresentations.

## About Yowsup
Yowsup is a python library that allows you to login and use the WhatsApp(TM) service and provides you with all capabilities of an official WhatsApp(TM) client, allowing you to create a full-fledged custom WhatsApp(TM) client. Yowsup also comes with a cross platform command-line frontend called yowsup-cli which allows you to jump into connecting and using WhatsApp(TM) service directly from command line.

### Requirements:
 * python 2.6+
 * [python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil)
 * **yowsup-cli** requires [argparse](http://code.google.com/p/argparse/) for python < 2.7
